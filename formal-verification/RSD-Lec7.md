## Logic

### Syntax
- An alphabet or a set of symbols
- expression: a finite sequence of ymbols
- well-formed expressions: expression following a set of rules

### Semantics
- Gives meaning to well-formed expressions
- Formal induction and recursion can be used to give rigorous semantics

## The SAT Problem
- It is decidable but NP-complete
- Therefore, checking the validity is co-NP-complete
- Many problems in formal verification can be reduced to checking the satisfiability of a formula in some logic
- NP-completeness here means the time need to solve a SAT problem grows exponentially with the number of propositional variables in the formula
