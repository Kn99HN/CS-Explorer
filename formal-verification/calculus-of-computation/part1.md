# Propositional Logic

## Syntax 

**Truth symbols**: True and False
**Propositional variables**: denoted by P,Q,R...

**Formula**: True, False or a propositional variable P, or the application of the connectives to formula:
- ~F: negation
- F1 && F2: conjunction
- F1 || F2: disjunction
- F1 -> F2: implication
- F1 <-> F2: iff

**arity**: the number of arguments that it takes

Negation takes one argument so it is unary but other connectives take two so it is binary. 

The left and right arguments of -> are called antecedent and consequent. 

**atom**: a truth symbol or propositional variable
**literal**: an atom or its negation. 
**formula**: literal or the application of logical connective to a formula

**subformula**: Formula G is subformula of F if it occurs syntactically within G.
